# Salary Data Analysis 📊

This project explores salary trends based on various factors such as **years of experience, age, and education level**. Using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the analysis visualizes how these factors correlate with salary.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset (`Salary Data.csv`) contains the following columns:
- **Age** 📅
- **Gender** 🚻
- **Education Level** 🎓
- **Job Title** 💼
- **Years of Experience** 📈
- **Salary** 💰

## 📌 Key Analyses

### 1️⃣ Salary vs. Years of Experience
- A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between **years of experience** and **salary**.
- A **trend line** (linear regression) is added to show the pattern.

### 2️⃣ Salary vs. Age
- Another scatter plot is used to analyze how **age impacts salary**.
- A **linear regression line** helps indicate the trend.

### 3️⃣ Top Earners
- The dataset is sorted by **salary** in descending order.
- The **top 50 earners** are analyzed based on **education level**.

### 4️⃣ Education Level vs. Salary
- The average salary for different **education levels** is calculated.
- A **bar chart** visualizes the relationship between **education level** and **salary**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈

## 📌 Results & Insights
